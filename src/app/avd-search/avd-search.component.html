    The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.

The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.

The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically so you won't have to do so in the component class.
